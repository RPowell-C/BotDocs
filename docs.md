# This is the documentation on Reid's unamed bot, this is NOT documentation on how to make one, as the bot itself is still closed source,this is instead documentation on it's functions and commands




# Basic info
## The bot only reads the last 10 characters of the chat and then looks for it's commands inside those last ten words, meaning that every command is programmed into the bot in it's main file

# Time + Date + Vaduz
## These is pretty self explanatory, it tells the time and the date using the datetime library

# Venmo
## This is a joke command that does nothing

# btc + ether + allcoins
## these are the same. They all use the cryptocompare library to look at the prices for various cryptocurrencies

# ver
## this shows the version of the bot, the codename and the source status

# radio
## this just displays the link to the chat radio

# randq + insult drinks + cuss
## these selects a random string and sends it to the chat

# DJ
## this displays the djs for the radio station

# gn
## it says goodnight

# station
## this looks at a link that is only available when the radio station is streaming, if it can access the link it then knows that the station is broadcasting, if it cannot, the station is not broadcasting

# source
## displays the webpage for this file
